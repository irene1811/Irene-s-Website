  <p> "Welcome to my engineering portfolio! <br>
I'm a rising senior and 3rd-year engineering student at Johns Creek High School looking to major in biomedical engineering after graduation.
Ever since I was little I've been drifting through different countries like a gypsy. I've lived in Korea, China, Taiwan, New Jersey and Georgia. I'm fluent in Korean and English, and proficient in Chinese. Robotics club, Science Olympiad and my engineering class has been my main outlet for my passion in engineering. Frankly, I'm addicted to the exhilarating advancement of technology and I'm eager to see more woman engineers in the future.<br>
I'm currently looking for internship and work experience, please contact me if an opportunity arises."
